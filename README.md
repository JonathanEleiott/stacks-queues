# Classes, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Stack and Queues

## Classes / Object-Oriented Programming

- Class -> template for an object
  - constructor -> initial values
  - methods -> "functions" on the class

## Stacks and Queues

- Arrays are actually data structures and not data types
- they are secretly objects behind the scenes
- by adding special rules to an array, we can make it a more specific data structure

## Stacks

- Application
  - Undo and Redo Button
  - Browser History
  - Function Call Stack

- General Rule
  - LIFO - Last In, First Out
  - FILO - First In, Last Out

- Common Methods
  - push() or add() -> add something to the stack
  - isEmtpy() -> is the stack empty?
  - peek() -> what is on top of the stack? (or last in the array)
  - pop() -> removes the next item in the stack (last item added)
  - count() -> how many items in the stack?

## Queues

- Application
  - Line at a Restaurant
  - Queue at a Hair Salon
  - Line at a Bank

- General Rule
  - FIFO - First In, First Out

- Common Methods
  - enqueue() -> add an item to the queue
  - dequeue() -> removes an item from the queue
  - peek() or front() -> see the next item in the queue
  - isEmpty() -> is there anything in the queue

## this Keyword

- refers to the object (class) that it is used in
